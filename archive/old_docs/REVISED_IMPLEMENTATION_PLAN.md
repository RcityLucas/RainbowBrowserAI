HTTP: reqwest (battle-tested)
Database: sqlx + SQLite (simple, reliable)
API: axum (fast, type-safe)
Config: serde + toml (standard)
Logging: tracing (Rust standard)
Testing: tokio-test (async testing)
```

### Phase 2+: Innovation Layer
```rust
// Advanced features after core is proven

```

## 💰 Cost Monitoring Framework

### LLM Usage Tracking
```rust
pub struct CostTracker {
    pub tokens_used: u64,
    pub api_calls: u64,
    pub estimated_cost: f64,
    pub daily_limit: f64,
    pub monthly_budget: f64,
}

impl CostTracker {
    pub fn check_budget(&self) -> Result<(), BudgetExceeded>;
    pub fn estimate_operation_cost(&self, prompt: &str) -> f64;
