# Day 4 Implementation Plan - Advanced Automation & Workflows ðŸš€

## Objective
Transform the PoC from single-command execution to multi-step workflow automation with scripting, conditionals, and data extraction capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Day 4 Goals

### 1. Workflow System Architecture
- **Workflow Definition**: YAML/JSON-based workflow descriptions
- **Step Execution**: Sequential and parallel step execution
- **State Management**: Share data between workflow steps
- **Error Recovery**: Retry and fallback strategies per step

### 2. Advanced Automation Features
- **Data Extraction**: Extract text, links, form data from pages
- **Form Filling**: Automated form completion with data
- **Wait Conditions**: Wait for elements, text, or custom conditions
- **Assertions**: Verify page state and content

### 3. Control Flow
- **Conditionals**: If/then/else logic based on page state
- **Loops**: Iterate over elements or data sets
- **Variables**: Store and reuse values across steps
- **Templates**: Parameterized workflows with inputs

### 4. Script Execution
- **YAML Workflows**: Human-readable workflow definitions
- **JSON Scripts**: Programmatic workflow generation
- **CLI Integration**: Execute workflows from command line
- **Natural Language**: "Run the login workflow"

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Engine (2-3 hours)
```rust
// workflow.rs - Core workflow execution engine
pub struct Workflow {
    name: String,
    description: String,
    steps: Vec<WorkflowStep>,
    variables: HashMap<String, Value>,
    config: WorkflowConfig,
}

pub struct WorkflowStep {
    name: String,
    action: ActionType,
    parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
    conditions: Vec<Condition>,
    on_error: ErrorStrategy,
}

pub enum ActionType {
    Navigate(NavigateAction),
    Click(ClickAction),
    Extract(ExtractAction),
    Fill(FillAction),
    Wait(WaitAction),
    Assert(AssertAction),
    Conditional(ConditionalAction),
    Loop(LoopAction),
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Operations (2-3 hours)
```rust
// data_operations.rs - Extract and manipulate page data
pub struct DataExtractor {
    // Extract text, links, attributes
    pub async fn extract_text(&self, selector: &str) -> Result<String>
    pub async fn extract_links(&self, pattern: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>>
    pub async fn extract_table(&self, selector: &str) -> Result<Vec<Vec<String>>>
}

pub struct FormFiller {
    // Fill forms with data
    pub async fn fill_text(&self, selector: &str, value: &str) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn select_option(&self, selector: &str, value: &str) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn click_checkbox(&self, selector: &str, checked: bool) -> Result<()>
}
```

### Phase 3: Control Flow & Logic (2-3 hours)
```rust
// control_flow.rs - Conditionals and loops
pub struct ConditionalExecutor {
    pub async fn evaluate_condition(&self, condition: &Condition) -> Result<bool>
    pub async fn execute_if_else(&self, branches: &[Branch]) -> Result<()>
}

pub struct LoopExecutor {
    pub async fn for_each(&self, items: &[Value], body: &[WorkflowStep]) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn while_condition(&self, condition: &Condition, body: &[WorkflowStep]) -> Result<()>
}
```

### Phase 4: Workflow Templates (1-2 hours)
```yaml
# templates/login_workflow.yaml
name: "Login Workflow"
description: "Automated login with credentials"
inputs:
  - username: string
  - password: string
  - site_url: string

steps:
  - name: "Navigate to login page"
    action: navigate
    url: "{{site_url}}/login"
    
  - name: "Fill credentials"
    action: fill_form
    fields:
      username_field: "{{username}}"
      password_field: "{{password}}"
      
  - name: "Submit login"
    action: click
    selector: "button[type='submit']"
    
  - name: "Verify login success"
    action: assert
    condition: "page_contains"
    text: "Dashboard"
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Workflow Execution Flow
1. **Parse**: Load workflow from YAML/JSON
2. **Validate**: Check syntax and requirements
3. **Initialize**: Set up variables and state
4. **Execute**: Run steps sequentially/parallel
5. **Handle Errors**: Apply retry/fallback strategies
6. **Report**: Generate execution summary

### Key Components

#### WorkflowEngine

#### DataStore
- Stores variables and extracted data
- Provides data to subsequent steps
- Supports complex data types
- Enables data transformation

#### ConditionEvaluator
- Evaluates conditional expressions
- Supports various operators
- Handles complex logic
- Integrates with page state

## ðŸ“Š Example Workflows

### E-commerce Test Workflow
```yaml
name: "E-commerce Purchase Test"
steps:
  - action: navigate
    url: "https://shop.example.com"
    
  - action: search
    query: "laptop"
    
  - action: extract
    selector: ".product-list"
    store_as: "products"
    
  - action: loop
    over: "{{products}}"
    steps:
      - action: click
        selector: ".add-to-cart"
        
  - action: navigate
    url: "/cart"
    
  - action: assert
    condition: "element_count"
    selector: ".cart-item"
    expected: "{{products.length}}"
```

### Multi-site Health Check
```yaml
name: "Service Health Check"
parallel: true
steps:
  - action: test_endpoint
    url: "https://api.service1.com/health"
    expect_status: 200
    
  - action: test_endpoint
    url: "https://api.service2.com/health"
    expect_status: 200
    
  - action: test_endpoint
    url: "https://api.service3.com/health"

3. **Scriptable Testing**: Automated test scenarios
4. **Reusable Templates**: Library of common workflows
5. **Natural Language**: "Run the checkout workflow with these items"

## ðŸ’° Budget Considerations

- Workflow execution: $0.01-0.05 per workflow (depends on steps)
- LLM parsing: $0.001-0.005 per natural language workflow command
- Total Day 4 budget: <$1.50 for comprehensive testing
- Remaining budget: >$3.50 for Day 5 optimization
