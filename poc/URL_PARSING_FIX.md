# URL Parsing Fix for Natural Language Commands

## Issue Description
**Problem**: When users input natural language commands like "go to stackoverflow and take screenshot", the system incorrectly parses "go" as the target domain and navigates to `https://www.go.com` instead of the intended `stackoverflow.com`.

**Root Cause**: The regex pattern in the mock mode URL parser captures command verbs (like "go") as domain names before proper filtering occurs.

**Affected File**: `poc/src/llm_service.rs` - `parse_command_mock()` function

## Technical Details

### Original Issue
The original regex pattern `r"([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}|[a-zA-Z0-9]+"` would match the first word "go" from "go to stackoverflow" and incorrectly append ".com" to create "go.com".

### Solution Overview
1. **Improved Command Filtering**: Filter out navigation verbs before URL extraction
2. **Known Sites Database**: Prioritize recognition of popular websites
3. **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Better word boundary detection to avoid false matches

## Implementation

### File Location
```
poc/src/llm_service.rs
Lines: ~552-615 (in parse_command_mock function)
```

### Code Changes
Replace the navigation command parsing block with the improved version that includes:

- **Two-stage URL detection**: First try complete URLs, then known sites
- **Smart filtering**: Remove command words while preserving target domains  
- **Known sites array**: Pre-defined mapping for popular websites
- **Fallback extraction**: Generic domain extraction with improved regex

## Installation Steps

1. **Stop the running server**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server
   ```

2. **Navigate to the POC directory**:
   ```bash
   cd poc
   ```

3. **Edit the source file**:
   ```bash
   # Open poc/src/llm_service.rs in your editor
   # Find lines ~552-615 in the parse_command_mock function
   # Replace the navigation parsing block with the improved version
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **Start the updated server**:
   ```bash
   RAINBOW_MOCK_MODE=true cargo run --release -- serve --port 3000
   ```

6. **Test the fix**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Enter: "go to stackoverflow and take screenshot"
   - Verify it navigates to `stackoverflow.com` instead of `go.com`

## Supported Commands After Fix

The improved parser correctly handles:
- ✅ "go to stackoverflow and take screenshot" → `stackoverflow.com`
- ✅ "navigate to google" → `google.com` 
- ✅ "open github.com" → `github.com`
- ✅ "visit youtube" → `youtube.com`
- ✅ "browse to reddit" → `reddit.com`

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see in the server logs:
```
INFO: Filtered input for URL extraction: 'stackoverflow'
INFO: Found known site: stackoverflow -> stackoverflow.com
INFO: Successfully navigated to: https://stackoverflow.com
```

This confirms the URL parsing is working correctly.
