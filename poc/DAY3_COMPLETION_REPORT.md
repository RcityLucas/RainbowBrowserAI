## 🧠 Intelligence Features Delivered

### Natural Language Examples Working
```bash
# Simple navigation
cargo run -- ask "navigate to google"
cargo run -- ask "go to github and take a screenshot"

# Multi-website testing
cargo run -- ask "test google, github, and stackoverflow"
cargo run -- ask "test these sites with screenshots: reddit, twitter, facebook"

# Advanced parameters
cargo run -- ask "navigate to example.com with a 1280x720 screenshot"
cargo run -- ask "test google and github with 5 retries each"

# Reporting
cargo run -- ask "show me the cost report"
cargo run -- ask "how much have I spent today?"
```

### Conversation Intelligence
- **Preference Learning**: Automatically detects if user frequently uses screenshots and makes it default
- **Site Memory**: Remembers frequently visited sites and suggests them
- **Command History**: Tracks successful patterns for better future suggestions
- **Context Enhancement**: Applies learned preferences to fill in missing parameters

### Smart URL Processing
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Handles URLs with/without http:// or https://
- **Domain Completion**: "google" automatically becomes "google.com"
- **www. Normalization**: Removes redundant www. prefixes
- **Validation**: Ensures URLs are properly formatted and safe

### Error Recovery & Fallbacks
- **API Key Missing**: Clear instructions for setup with structured command alternatives
- **Parsing Failure**: Helpful suggestions with example commands
- **Low Confidence**: Warning with option to proceed or use structured commands
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling with detailed error context

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### LLM Service Architecture

- **Cost Calculation**: Precise token-based cost tracking for different model tiers
- **Response Parsing**: Robust JSON extraction with validation and cleanup
- **Configuration**: Environment-based API key management with secure defaults

### Context System
- **Persistent Storage**: JSON-based conversation history with automatic cleanup
- **Memory Management**: Keeps last 50 commands to prevent file growth
- **Preference Inference**: Statistical analysis of usage patterns
- **Privacy Conscious**: No sensitive data stored, only command patterns

### Command Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Analysis**: Parse natural language with context awareness
2. **Intent Recognition**: Classify command type (navigate/test/report)
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Extract URLs, options, and preferences
4. **Context Enhancement**: Apply user preferences and smart defaults
5. **Validation**: Ensure parameters are safe and reasonable
6. **Execution**: Route to appropriate handler with full error tracking
7. **Learning**: Update preferences and history based on results

### Security & Safety
- **Input Validation**: All URLs and parameters validated before execution
