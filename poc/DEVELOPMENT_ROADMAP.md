    fallback_selectors: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    visual_analyzer: VisualElementAnalyzer,
}

impl SmartElementDetector {
    async fn find_element(&self, description: &str) -> Result<WebElement> {
        // 1. Try semantic analysis
        if let Ok(element) = self.ai_powered_detection(description).await {
            return Ok(element);
        }
        
        // 2. Try common patterns
