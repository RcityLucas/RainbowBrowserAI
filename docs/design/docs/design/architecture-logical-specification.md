**Overview**
- Purpose: Provide a unified, precise logical specification for SoulBrowser.
- Scope: External contracts and observable behaviors, quality attributes, domain objects, state models, and flows. Implementation details are deferred to the technical document.

**Goals & Non‑Goals**
- Goals
  - Expose a stable, simplified contract for AI agents via 3 perception modes and 12 standard tools.
  - Ensure reliability, performance, and decision transparency across sessions and executions.
- Non‑Goals
  - Prescribe specific algorithms, data structures, or code layout.
  - Lock to a single storage engine; define contracts for pluggable persistence.

**System Context**
- Actors
  - AI Agent/SDK: Consumes APIs for sessions, perception, tool execution, introspection.
  - Administrator/Ops: Uses health/metrics/version endpoints; manages deployments.
  - External Services: Optional data stores and telemetry backends.
- Boundaries
  - Provided APIs: `sessions`, `perception`, `tools`, `executions`, `health`, `metrics`, `version`.
  - Internal Engines: unified-kernel, layered-perception, intelligent-action, persistence, performance/stability engines.

**Capability Model**
- Session Management
  - Create/inspect/terminate sessions; status: `active | paused | terminated | error | recovering`.
  - Configuration: engine, viewport, performance mode, adaptive sensing, decision trace.
- Perception (External Contract: 3 layers)
  - Modes: `fast (<50ms) | standard (<200ms) | deep (<500ms) | adaptive`.
  - Results structure: always includes `fast_data`; `standard_data` present in standard/deep; `deep_data` in deep.
  - Decision context explains mode selection; processing metrics expose latency and efficiency.
- Intelligent Action (12 Standard Tools)
  - Navigation: `navigate_to_url`, `scroll_page`.
  - Interaction: `click`, `type_text`, `select_option`.
  - Synchronization: `wait_for_element`, `wait_for_condition`.
  - Memory: `get_element_info`, `take_screenshot`, `retrieve_history`.
  - Meta-cognitive: `report_insight`, `complete_task`.
  - Execution strategies: `sequential | parallel | intelligent` with global/local options.
- Executions & Monitoring
  - Execution lifecycle: `pending → running → completed | failed | recovering` with progress and metrics.
  - Health/metrics: system health status, resource usage, performance indicators, alerts.
- Decision Transparency
  - Perception mode rationale; tool plan; error recovery path; performance tradeoffs.

**Domain Model (Logical)**
- Session(session_id, created_at, status, config, health_metrics, performance_summary, active_tabs, decision_history?)
- PerceptionResult(mode_used, fast_data, standard_data?, deep_data?, processing_metrics, decision_context)
- ToolInvocation(tool_id, tool_name, parameters, execution_options)
- Execution(execution_id, session_id, status, progress, tools_results[], performance_metrics, error_details?)
- HealthMetrics(overall_health, resource_usage, performance_indicators, active_alerts[], trend_analysis)
- VersionInfo(version, release_info, compatibility_info, ecosystem_info)

**State Models**
- Session State
  - Created → Active → {Paused ↔ Active} → {Terminated | Error → Recovering → Active | Terminated}
  - Constraints: recoverable transitions preserve decision trace and minimal state snapshot.
- Execution State
  - Pending → Running → {Completed | Failed → Recovering → {Running | Failed}}.
  - Backpressure rules limit concurrent executions per session.

**Data Flow (Happy Path)**
- Request (Agent) → Create Session → Perception (adaptive) → Decision (plan+strategy) → Tools Execution → Persistence (results/snapshots) → Health check → Response (result ids + summaries).
- Feedback loops:
  - Persistence → Perception (caching, historical hints)
  - Metrics → Scheduler (adaptive mode and throttling)
  - Errors → Recovery (smart retry, re‑perceive, degrade)

**Functional Requirements**
- Sessions
  - R1. Create session with sensible defaults; return session state and ids.
  - R2. Query session returns live health/perf summaries and decision history when enabled.
  - R3. Termination gracefully flushes buffers, persists minimal last state.
- Perception
  - R4. Provide `fast | standard | deep | adaptive`; honor performance budgets.
  - R5. Always include `fast_data`; include higher-tier data conditionally.
  - R6. Return processing metrics and mode selection explanation when tracing enabled.
- Tools & Executions
  - R7. Accept 1–10 tool calls per request; schedule per chosen strategy.
  - R8. Expose execution status with progress, per-tool results, and performance metrics.
  - R9. Provide standardized error taxonomy and recovery suggestions.
- Health & Metrics
  - R10. System health endpoint with overall health, indicators, alerts, and trends.
  - R11. Metrics endpoint exposes perception latencies, tool success rates, cache hit rates, resource usage.
- Versioning
  - R12. Version endpoint provides semantic versioning and compatibility flags.

**Non‑Functional Requirements (SLOs & Constraints)**
- Performance
  - Perception latencies: Fast <50ms P95; Standard <200ms P95; Deep <500ms P95 under nominal load.
  - Tool execution baselines per tool class; queueing/backpressure to protect tail latency.
- Availability & Reliability
  - Service availability ≥99.9%; automatic recovery paths for common failures; idempotent termination.
- Efficiency
  - Resource usage budgets & compression targets for persisted artifacts.
- Security & Privacy
  - Bearer auth; session isolation; PII minimization and optional redaction in persisted artifacts.
- Observability
  - Tracing spans for session, perception, execution; Prometheus metrics for latencies/success/error/retry.

**External Contract vs Internal Architecture**
- External: 3 perception modes (Fast/Standard/Deep) plus Adaptive.
- Internal: Implementation may use additional internal stages for modularity; Adaptive maps external request → internal plan. Required: external behavior must conform to 3-tier contract and budgets.

**Quality Attributes & Tactics**
- Resilience: retries with jitter; timeouts; circuit breakers; bulkheads per session.
- Scalability: horizontal scaling by session sharding; per-session resource limits; async concurrency.
- Modifiability: clear module boundaries; schema‑first API and data models; feature flags for experimental paths.
- Testability: deterministic adapters; stable fixtures; performance and chaos probes.

**Assumptions & Open Questions**
- Assumptions
  - Default storage engine is a multi‑model DB; repository can be swapped for alternative backends.
  - Headless browser control via compliant driver abstraction (e.g., Playwright/Fantoccini).
- Open Questions
  - Which external data layer(s) to certify first for plug‑in persistence?
  - Scope of decision trace persistence retention and privacy defaults.
