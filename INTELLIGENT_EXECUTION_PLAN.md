# Intelligent Task Execution Plan

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have âœ…
1. **Enhanced LLM Understanding**: Can classify complex commands into TaskTypes (Planning, Search, Analysis, etc.)
2. **Task Decomposition**: Creates multi-step plans with dependencies
3. **Workflow Engine**: Existing workflow.rs can execute ActionType steps sequentially or in parallel
4. **Browser Automation**: SimpleBrowser can navigate, screenshot, extract data
5. **Command Parsing**: Natural language â†’ structured commands with 85% confidence

### What's Missing ðŸ”§
1. **Bridge Between Understanding and Execution**: No connection between TaskPlan and WorkflowEngine
2. **Dynamic Workflow Generation**: Cannot convert TaskPlan â†’ Workflow automatically
3. **Intelligent Execution**: No adaptive execution based on task type
4. **Progress Tracking**: No real-time feedback during multi-step execution
5. **Result Aggregation**: No way to combine results from multiple steps

## Proposed Solution: Task Execution Coordinator

### Architecture
```
User Command â†’ LLM Understanding â†’ Task Plan â†’ Execution Coordinator â†’ Workflow Engine â†’ Results
                     â†“                              â†“                        â†“
                TaskType +                   Dynamic Workflow           Browser Actions
                Steps                         Generation                    â†“
                                                                       Aggregated Results
```

### Implementation Modules

#### 1. Task Execution Coordinator (New Module)
**File**: `poc/src/task_executor.rs`
- Convert TaskPlan â†’ Workflow
- Map TaskType to execution strategy
- Handle progress updates
- Aggregate results

#### 2. Enhanced Main.rs Integration
- Connect natural language parsing to task executor
- Provide real-time feedback during execution
- Display aggregated results

#### 3. Workflow Adapter
- Convert ActionStep â†’ WorkflowStep
- Map parameters correctly
- Handle dependencies

### Task Type Execution Strategies

#### Planning Tasks (e.g., "give me a travel plan")
1. Parse into 6-step plan
2. Execute each step with browser automation
3. Aggregate results (screenshots, extracted data)
4. Generate comprehensive report

#### Search Tasks
1. Navigate to search engine
2. Enter search query
3. Extract top results
4. Visit top sites
5. Compile findings

#### Analysis Tasks
1. Navigate to target
2. Extract all content
3. Analyze with metrics
4. Generate insights

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Task Executor Module** (1 file, ~300 lines)
   - TaskExecutor struct
   - Convert TaskPlan to Workflow
   - Execute with progress tracking
   - Result aggregation

2. **Enhance Main.rs** (~50 lines modification)
   - Add case for "planning" action
   - Call task executor
   - Display progress and results

3. **Test Integration**
   - "give me a travel plan" â†’ Full execution
   - "search for restaurants" â†’ Search execution
   - "analyze website" â†’ Analysis execution

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Perception**: System understands intent
2. **Automatic Execution**: Converts understanding to action
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: Different strategies per task type
4. **User-Friendly**: Natural language â†’ Complete results
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new task types

## Next Module to Implement

**Priority**: `task_executor.rs` - This is the bridge between understanding and execution

This module will:
- Be independent (uses existing workflow.rs and browser.rs)
- Enable full end-to-end intelligent execution
- Complete the perception â†’ execution pipeline

## Success Criteria

When complete, the system will:
1. Accept: "give me a travel plan for Paris"
2. Understand: TaskType::Planning with 6 steps
3. Execute: All 6 browser automation steps
4. Return: Comprehensive travel plan with flights, hotels, attractions, weather
