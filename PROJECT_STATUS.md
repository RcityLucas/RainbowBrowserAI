## The Bridge Challenge üåâ

### Problem
We have two excellent but disconnected codebases:
- **POC**: Working, functional, users can use it today
- **Architecture**: Beautiful design, SOLID principles, but mostly stubs

### Solution: Evolution Bridge
**Strategy**: Systematically migrate POC functionality into the six-organ architecture while preserving all working features.

**Key Principle**: Never break what's working while building what's needed.
