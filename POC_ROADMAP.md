   - Fallback: Cached responses for testing

### Low Probability / High Impact Risks
1. **OpenAI API changes**
   - Mitigation: Version pinning
   - Fallback: Multiple LLM providers

2. **Browser security restrictions**

## Success Metrics

### Primary
- **End-to-end success rate**: >90%
- **Average operation time**: <5 seconds

## Next Steps if GO Decision
1. Set up MVP development environment
2. Expand to multi-browser support
3. Add parallel task execution
4. Implement database persistence
5. Create REST API interface

## Next Steps if NO-GO Decision
1. Document lessons learned
2. Archive proof of concept
3. Evaluate alternative approaches
4. Consider pivoting to simpler use case
5. Reassess market opportunity

This 2-week roadmap provides a clear path to validate the core technical assumptions with minimal risk and maximum learning.
