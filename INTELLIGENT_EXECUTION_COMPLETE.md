**File**: `poc/src/llm_service/llm_service_enhanced.rs`
- **TaskType Classification**: 11 task types (Planning, Search, Analysis, etc.)
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks complex commands into actionable steps
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies locations, dates, websites
- **Confidence Scoring**: 85% confidence for recognized tasks vs 30% for unknown

### 2. Task Execution Coordinator (NEW ✅)
**File**: `poc/src/task_executor.rs`
- **TaskPlan → Workflow Conversion**: Automatic translation to executable steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during multi-step execution
- **Result Aggregation**: Combines screenshots, data, and insights
- **Task-Specific Strategies**: Different execution patterns per task type

### 3. Enhanced Main Integration (UPDATED ✅)
**File**: `poc/src/main.rs`
- **"planning" Action Handler**: Connects natural language to full execution
- **TaskExecutor Integration**: Seamless bridging between understanding and doing
- **User Feedback**: Real-time progress and comprehensive results

## 🚀 End-to-End Flow

```
User: "give me a travel plan"
   ↓
🧠 LLM Understanding:
   - Classifies as TaskType::Planning
   - Creates 6-step travel plan:
     1. Search destination info
     2. Find flights
     3. Find hotels
     4. Research attractions  
     5. Check weather
     6. Compile summary
   ↓
🎯 Task Executor:
   - Converts to executable workflow
   - Orchestrates browser automation
   - Tracks progress in real-time
   - Aggregates results
   ↓
📊 Intelligent Results:
   - Travel plan summary
   - Screenshots from each step
   - Recommendations
   - Cost tracking
```

## 🧩 Architecture Components

### Core Intelligence Stack
1. **Command Parser** (`llm_service.rs`) - Understands natural language
2. **Task Planner** (`llm_service_enhanced.rs`) - Creates structured plans  
3. **Execution Coordinator** (`task_executor.rs`) - Bridges planning and action
4. **Workflow Engine** (`workflow.rs`) - Executes browser automation
5. **Results Aggregator** (`task_executor.rs`) - Combines and presents results

### Key Capabilities Achieved
- ✅ **Natural Language Understanding**: "give me a travel plan" → structured plan
- ✅ **Intelligent Decomposition**: Complex tasks → actionable steps
- ✅ **Automatic Execution**: Plans → browser automation
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during execution
- ✅ **Smart Aggregation**: Multiple results → comprehensive insights
- ✅ **Task Adaptation**: Different strategies per task type

## 🎉 What This Enables

### Before (Manual Commands)
```bash
cargo run -- navigate google.com --screenshot
cargo run -- navigate booking.com --screenshot  
cargo run -- navigate tripadvisor.com --screenshot
# Manual result compilation
```

### After (Intelligent Execution)
```bash
cargo run -- ask "give me a travel plan"
# Automatic: Understanding → Planning → Execution → Results
```

### Sample Output (When Complete)
